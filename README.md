# Java Design Patterns

# Behavioral Design Patterns
1. Strategy
	Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
2. Observer
	Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Creational Design Patterns
1. Factory
	Defines an interface for creating objects, but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate and Refers to the newly created object through a common interface.
2. Abstract Factory 
	Offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.
3. Singleton
	Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and Provide a global access point to the object.
4. Builder
5. Prototype
